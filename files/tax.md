## Compute for the Taxable Income
Step 1: Compute for your taxable income, which is your basic salary (plus additional pays like holiday and overtime pays) minus your contributions.

Taxable Income = (Monthly Basic Pay + Additional Pay) – (SSS + PhilHealth + PAG-IBIG + Deductions Due to Absences/Tardiness)

SSS CONTRIBUTION TABLE
SALARY RANGE	CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT
1000 – 1249.99	36.30
1250 – 1749.99	54.50
1750 – 2249.99	72.70
2250 – 2749.99	90.80
2750 – 3249.99	109.00
3250 – 3749.99	127.20
3750 – 4249.99	145.30
4250 – 4749.99	163.50
4750 – 5249.99	181.70
5250 – 5749.99	199.80
5750 – 6249.99	218.00
6250 – 6749.99	236.20
6750 – 7249.99	254.30
7250 – 7749.99	272.50
7750 – 8249.99	290.70
8250 – 8749.99	308.80
8750 – 9249.99	327.00
9250 – 9749.99	345.20
9750 – 10249.99	363.30
10250 – 10749.99	381.50
10750 – 11249.99	399.70
11250 – 11749.99	417.80
11750 – 12249.99	436.00
12250 – 12749.99	454.20
12750 – 13249.99	472.30
13250 – 13749.99	490.50
13750 – 14249.99	508.70
14250 – 14749.99	526.80
14750 – 15249.99	545.00
15250 – 15749.99	563.20
15750 and above	581.30
Below is the PhilHealth contribution table:

PHILHEALTH CONTRIBUTION TABLE
SALARY RANGE (x 2.75%)	CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT
10000 and below	275.00
10000.01 – 39999.99	275.02 – 1099.99
40000 and above	1100

Suppose that you are earning P23000 a month, the computation for the taxable income will be as follows:

Taxable Income = (23000) – (581.30 + ((23000 * 0.0275) / 2) + 100.00)
= (23000) – (997.55)
Taxable Income = 22002.45

Step 2: Compute for the income tax

## How to Compute for the Income Tax
Tax computation in the Philippines changed this January 2018 in the form of the Tax Reform Bill of the Duterte Administration. The current tax table is relatively simpler, and allows employees to take home more money than before.

BIR TAX TABLE	
SALARY RANGE (ANNUAL)	INCOME TAX RATE
250000 and below	0%
250000.01 to 400000	20% of the excess over 250000
400000.01 to 800000	30000 + 25% of the excess over 400000
800000.01 to 2000000	130000 + 30% of the excess over 800000
2000000.01 to 8000000	490000 + 32% of the excess over 2000000
8000000.01 and above	2410000 + 35% of the excess over 8000000
Income Tax = (((Taxable Income * 12) – X) * Y) / 12
Where X is the minimum value of the particular salary range, and Y is the respective percentage

Since your taxable income is 22002.45, the computation will be as follows:

Income Tax = (((22002.45 * 12) – 250000) * 0.20) / 12
= ((264029.4 – 250000) * 0.20) / 12
= 2805.88 / 12
Income Tax = 233.82

Step 3: Subtract your income tax from your taxable income.

Net Pay = Taxable Income – Income Tax
= 22002.45 – 233.82
Net Pay = 21768.63
