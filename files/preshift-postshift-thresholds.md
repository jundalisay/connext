Pre-shift & Post Shift Thresholds
How do Pre-Shift & Post- Shift Thresholds Work?
Pre-shift and Post-shift thresholds were put in place to prevent logs from getting assigned to the incorrect shift.
Understanding how they work is more important than it would seem at first, especially when it already applies to filing
overtimes and crediting the work hours properly to their respective dates.
Log ins and log outs must be within the following thresholds on Sprout HR:
For employees on Normal and Flexi-per-week schedule type:
•
•
Log in/s – must be within 6 hours before the shift start
Log out/s – must be within 8 hours after the shift end
Here are some examples:
1. If your schedule is from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM
-Log in must be within 1:00 AM to 7:00 AM
-Log out must be within 4:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
2. If your schedule is from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM
-Log in must be within 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM
-Log out must be within 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM.
3. If your schedule is from 2:00 AM to 11:00 AM
-Log in must be within 8:00 PM to 2:00 AM
-Log out must be within 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM
Note: If you are tagged with Missing Logs for a day but you have logs, make sure to check if your logs are within your
pre-shift & post-shift threshold. If not, please make sure to file your Certificate of Attendance (COA).
