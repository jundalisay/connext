Certificate of Attendance
How to file for a Certificate of Attendance (COA) Application:
You can easily file for Certificate of Attendance (COA) through Sprout HR, and the request will go to your supervisor
immediately. The COA replaces biologs on days when an employee either forgets or is unable to manually log into the
system via the biometric device. There are two ways to file a COA. Let's take a closer look at these two below:
Via the My Stuff panel on the dashboard

1. Under the My Stuff panel, click Apply and select Certificate of Attendance from the drop-down list that appears.
2. Input the correct details by choosing the reason as to why you were unable to log, and adding the details of the Attendance log (Biometric Mode - In/Out, Date, Time).
3. Click the submit button, and a notification message will appear if your application was submitted successfully.
Via My Requests/Approvals tab on the Navigation toolbar. 
Click the My Requests/Approvals tab and choose My Certificate of Attendance from the drop-down list that appears.
2. Select the +Add icon at the right-hand side
3. Input the correct details by choosing the reason as to why you were unable to log, and adding the details of the Attendance log (Biometric Mode - In/Out, Date, Time).
