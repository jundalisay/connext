PAID TIME-OFF (PTO)/LEAVE POLICY

To ensure consistency and fairness for Paid Time-Off and create clarity for holiday staffing, all active employees will be given leave credits for every month of service.

Employee Type | Leave Credits Per Year | Leave Credits Per Month 
--- | --- | --- 
Rank-and-File Employees | 20 | 1.67 
Supervisory, Managerial, and Executive | 22 | 1.83

All employees will start earning leave credits on his/her first month with Connext.

Example:

Start date | First leave Accrual
--- | --- 
January 1 | February 1 | 

- Paid Time-Off should be filed at least 2 weeks before the time-off date to give time for the leaders to project staffing. It must be filed in Sprout HR ahead of time and must be approved by the employee’s supervisor before the timesheet locks.
- If a leave is filed within 2 weeks before the PTO date, leave approval is based on the discretion of the direct supervisor.
- Paid Time-Offs that are filed on or after the actual time-off date will be tagged as unplanned leave which is a Perfect Attendance Bonus disqualifier
- A maximum of 5 unused Paid Time-Off will be carried over for the following year. All other unused Paid Time-Off will expire at the end of the year
- All employees are encouraged to take their paid time off for the year. As such, unused PTOs are not convertible to cash.
- Paid Time-Off is deducted from the total leave credits on the actual date of the leave, not when the leave is filed. See illustration below:


Title | Details
--- | ---
Total Leave Credits before filing PTO | 6 days
Filing Date | December 15, 2023
Scenario | The employee filed a 3-day PTO for January 8 - 10, 2024.
Total Leave Credits after the employees' PTO | 2 days
Reason | The 3 days PTO was deducted from the 5 unused PTO that was carried over for the
year 2024. The other 1 day expired December 31.

- If the employee filed a resignation, all unused leave credits after separation will expire and will not be converted into cash.

- Employees on maternity leave, floating status, and preventive suspension are deemed inactive and will not earn Paid Time-Offs during the month that they are out.
- A rank-and-file employee who’s promoted to supervisory role will accrue 1.83 Paid Time-Offs every month after the effective date of his/her promotion. 
- An employee with zero leave credits can still file a Paid Time-Off for a maximum of 3 paid time-off days provided that the employee ran out of leaves and there is a client mandated time-off.
- Employees’ supervisors are responsible in making sure that the Paid Time-Offs filed by their team members for these 3 days allowable are for client mandated holidays/client mandated time-off only.
- Employees with a negative number of leave credits upon separation with Connext will be deducted to the corresponding amount from their final pay. The formula is: negative leave balance x employee’s daily rate = deduction
