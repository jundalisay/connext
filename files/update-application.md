How To Update Pending Attendance Application

It is not unheard of in Sprout HR to find yourself in a situation where your attendance application is still pending with
your immediate supervisor when for some reason, the organizational chart shifts, or your position changes, and you
suddenly have a new manager to report to.
In this situation, who gets the duty of approving an employee's pending applications?
The short answer: The pending application stays within your previous approver but you can simply opt to update or
resubmit your application so your new approver will be given the task to approve your request.

Here’s How:
1. On Employee dashboard, click on the My Requests tab and select Pending applications.
2. Click on the Update button.
3. This will take you to the application page itself.
4. Upon clicking the Apply button, the application will be transferred to the employee’s new approver for his
approval.
