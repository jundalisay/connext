Setting-Up Rest Day Work
Did you report to work during your rest day to do some work overtime?
There are times when you need to render a Working Rest Day or even have to work beyond your scheduled rest day
shift. As such, necessary applications should be filed to get the premium rate.
Employees who were asked to work during their rest day must file a schedule adjustment for the system to recognize
that there is a work scheduled assigned on that day. Go to My Stuff > Select Schedule Adjustment > Set Effectivity Date.
If you worked beyond the approved 8-hour rest day work schedule, only then can you file an Overtime application.
Please see the illustration below for reference:
Regular Working Days: Tuesday to Saturday
Rest Days: Sunday and Monday
Rest Day Schedule Adjustment Request: Monday 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM
Monthly Basic Salary: PHP 22,000.00 (Semi-monthly: PHP 11,000.00)
Important Note: Since this is a rest day work, the checkbox should be ticked, and the padlock should be open on the
filing.

When Filing:
This is how your attendance looks like after filing it correctly:


Please note that there is no need to file overtime if you applied for a RD-work (schedule adjustment) unless there is a
work beyond the 8-hour approved schedule (9 hours including break).

Any work within the approved schedule adjustment will be paid as RD premium.
Any work beyond the approved schedule will be paid as RD-OT premium.
This is how a successful Rest Day Work and Rest Day – OT application looks like in employee’s payslip:
w/ approved RD-work - Monday (6:00 AM – 3:00 PM)
w/ approved RD-work - Monday (6:00 AM – 3:00 PM)
w/ approved RD-OT - Monday (3:00 PM – 5:00 PM)

Follow these steps and your rest day work is sure to be compensated for correctly!
